<div class="entry">
Blood network is a network of friends and families to facilitate the prompt and easy reach of the ‘gift of life’ – Blood. 
Inspired by a personal experience, that was amidst the most life – threatening moment; amidst fear of losing someone, Blood Network rushed as a clear need for anyone in a similar situation. We could not but reflect on the fact that a pizza reaches faster than most essential life savers like an ambulance, police and also Blood – which may be the only thing that can save a person’s life. The delays are inevitable because we realized we are so ‘unaware’ of the basic about our close ones. <br/>
It dawned we take for granted simple yet important things. Ask yourself – do you know the blood group of the people you meet everyday, your best friends and family? – They will be the only ones you will call in an emergency. Think about it!!
<br/>
Blood Network is an initiative to connect people according to their blood groups across the world. Here friends & family will be connected so as to reach within seconds to the particular blood group and the set of friends and family members directly. So that in case of an emergency you will not lose that precious time and save a life. <br/>
<font  color="#CC0000">"So join in to the Blood Network, be a savior of life - update your profile so that the people reach you when they need, share it with your friends on the noble work and start giving the ‘gift of life’." </font>
