Blood Network is an application established on facebook platform.<br />
<ul><li>User just needs to fill some information that contains blood group details<br /></li>
<li>Based on details filled by you and your friends, groups are made based on blood group &amp; place, so that whenever you need a blood in emergency, you don't need to call every person and find their blood group first.</li>
<li> Instead, just go to the blood network application, put the search criteria of place &amp; blood group, and you will get the list of your friends and family segregated based on the search criteria</p></li></ul>
